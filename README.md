This is the website at phpdublin.com

At the moment it's little more than a replica of our meetup.com listing, with details of the upcomming meetup.

A proper community resource (news? mailing list? jobs posting?) might be a more interesting use of the space. If you have ideas for what you'd like to see, maybe open or respond to an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/PHPDublin/phpdublin.com/issues).
