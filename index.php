    <p><strong>We're back in June with a couple of great talks!</strong></p>
    <p><a href="http://twitter.com/kenguest">Ken Guest</a> will be talking to us about Phing, a PHP build tool that can be used for analysing and deploying your project.</p>
    <p>and <a href="http://twitter.com/barryosull">Barry O'Sullivan</a> will be guiding us through the difficult but essential task of Managing the Expectations of Clients and Managers.</p>
