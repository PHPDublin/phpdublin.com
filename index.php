    <p><strong>We're back in August for a session of lightning talks!</strong></p>
    <p>A lightning talk is a quick one - 5-10 minutes on a single concept, idea, feature or product.</p>
    <p>If you've got something you'd like to talk about, let us know! It can be as short as just 5 minutes so a perfect opportunity to trial some otherwise untested speaking/presenting skills!</p>

    <h3>New Venue!</h3>
    <p>Thanks to <a href="http://kitmanlabs.com">Kitman Labs</a> (<a href="http://careers.kitmanlabs.com">they're hiring</a> !) we've got a new city-centre venue on Joyceâ€™s Walk, just off Talbot Street.</p>

    <h3>I wanna talk!</h3>
    <p>Great! We'd love to hear from you. If you have a talk you would like to give, please <a href="/contact">send us details</a>. Don't be shy.</p>

    <h3>Doors open 7pm</h3>
