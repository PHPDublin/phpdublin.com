This is the first in a series of guest articles that have been written by the community.

Our first article is from <a href="https://github.com/conorsmith" target="__blank">Conor Smith</a>, one of our meetup attendees.

Conor gives us a hands on demonstration of how to use PHP 5.5's generators to write better command line applications. 

```php
function someGenerator()
{
  yield "first value";
  yield "second value";
}
```

If you've ever written a long running console command, you know how hard it is to keep the display logic out of the domain logic, well Conor shows us exactly how to do this.
