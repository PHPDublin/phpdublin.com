Have you ever added messy code checking that a value is actually an int, a string or an email address? 
Have you noticed that you end up copying this code, muddying up your codebase and making it harder to understand what's going on? 

Well, I have, and that's why I use the ValueObject pattern. It's a simple, tactical pattern that enables you to encapsulate validation logic for values, in an easy, re-usable way. At our August meetup, I presented a brief micro-talk outlining the concept and showing you how it can be used in your project.
