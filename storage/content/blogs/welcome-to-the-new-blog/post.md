So, we've been busy this month with the PHP Dublin site. We've made a lot of changes, and we're looking forward to getting the community involved.

#### What have we done?

Well, we've moved the site over to **Laravel 5.1**, and we've added a new feature, a **Markdown blog**.
Rather than integrating with Wordpress (bleh!), or some other blogging system, we decided that our publishing process would be run off Github.

That's right, if you want to publish an article, you have to commit it to the repo. Once committed, it will automatically get published. That also means that everyone that publishes an article is a contributor to the site, isn't that cool?

#### Markdown
The posts are written in Markdown, which is a lightweight markup language used all over the web. You've seen it in action if you've ever visited a Github repo. The nicely formatted readme.md file? Markdown.
Markdown's limited syntax allows us to make sure that our blog posts are visually consistent and easy to read and write.

We're gonna talk this week about how we designed this blog, the architecture choices we made, and how we're going to build it up in future. We're also gonna show you how to create your own article, so you can publish your content on the blog.

We're actively looking for new content for the blog. If you're interested in getting something out there, then come to the talk and see how easy it is!
