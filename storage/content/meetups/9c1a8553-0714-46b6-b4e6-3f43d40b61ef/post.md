## September Talks

We have two talks taking place this month.
The first is from **Nexus Point Ltd**, they're going to take us through a new system that they're developing, a light talk with some design discussion, should be interesting.
Our second talk is from **Barry O Sullivan** and it's about Laravel 5.1, and how we used it to make the site/blog easy to use and update.

Let's not forget the food, drinks and networking after the talks!

### The Venue
Many thanks to **Kitman Labs** (they're hiring !) we've got a new city-centre venue on Joyceâ€™s Walk, just off Talbot Street.

### I wanna talk!
Great! We'd love to hear from you. If you have a talk you would like to give, please send us details. Don't be shy!

In fact, if you need a template for your talk, feel free to use ours!

### Doors open 7pm
