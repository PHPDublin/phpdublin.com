                    <p><strong>September Talks</strong></p>
                    <p>We have two talks taking place this month. <br>The first is from <b>Nexus Point Ltd</b>, they're going to take us through a new system that they're developing, a light talk with some design discussion, should be interesting.
                    <br>Our second talk is from <b>Barry O Sullivan</b> and it's about Laravel 5.1, and how we used it to make the site/blog easy to use and update.</p>
                    <p>Let's not forget the food, drinks and networking after the talks!</p>
                    <h3>The Venue</h3>
