                    <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
                    <h2>The Quick Version</h2>
                    <p>PHPDublin is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.</p>
                    <p>We do not tolerate harassment of community members or participants in any form.</p>

                    <h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>
                    <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
                    <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
                    <p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. </p>
                    <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference or event with no refund.</p>
                    <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the organising team immediately.</p>
